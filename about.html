      <p>
        This application converts grayscale images into 3D models that can be
        viewed and downloaded in different file formats. Simple drawing tools
        are also provided for creating the images.
      </p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <p>
        You can rotate (left-mouse or finger swipe), zoom (scroll wheel or
        finger pinch) and pan (right-mouse or two-finger swipe) around the 3D
        scene to inspect the model.
      </p>

      <h2>Images</h2>
      <p>
        A set of example images are included for inspiration. Original images
        can be created using any decent drawing or image-editing application. A
        minimal drawing tool is included that can be used to draw and download a
        grayscale image. In addition, grayscale images can be algorithmically
        generated, although currently only one algorithm is provided.
      </p>

      <h2>Exporting</h2>
      <p>
        3D models can be exported as <kbd>.stl</kbd>, <kbd>.obj</kbd> and
        <kbd>.glb</kbd> files for use in other 3D software or 3D printing.
        Model topology may need to be cleaned up for your specific application.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I made this tool to be a free, easy and portable way to experiment with 3D.

      </p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The application is largely written using Vanilla JavaScript and relies on
        <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com">Babylon.js</a> for 3D rendering.
      </p>

      <h2>Plans</h2>
      <p>
        Add heightmap preparation tips | new examples | more drawing algorithms | add dates to downloads | more mesh customisation | test models on 3D printer | accessibility improvements
      </p>
