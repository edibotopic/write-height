      <p>
        This application converts grayscale images into 3D models that can be
        viewed and downloaded.
      </p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <p>
        You can rotate (left-mouse or finger swipe), zoom (scroll wheel or
        finger pinch) and pan (right-mouse or two-finger swipe) around the 3D
        scene to inspect the model.
      </p>

      <h2>Images</h2>
      <p>
        A set of example images are included for inspiration. Original images
        can be created using any decent drawing or image-editing application and
        then uploaded.
      </p>

      <h2>Exporting</h2>
      <p>
        3D models can be exported as <kbd>.stl</kbd> files for use in
        other 3D software or 3D printing. Model topology may need to be cleaned
        up for your specific application.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I made this tool to be a free, easy and portable way to experiment with
        3D. View source code on
        <a href="https://github.com/edibotopic/write-height">Github</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The application is written using Vanilla JavaScript and relies on
        <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com">Babylon.js</a> for 3D rendering.
      </p>

      <h2>Plans</h2>
      <p>
        There is a memory issue that results in multiple downloads being
        triggered during model export. I am working (slowly) to resolve this.
